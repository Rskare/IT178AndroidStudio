This was submitted for my final project during the Fall 2020 semester while attending IT178. 

You can find the code for the SnakeActivity and SnakeEngine at http://gamecodeschool.com/android/coding-a-snake-game-for-android/

For this project I implemented main menu, game over, and leaderboard activities.

Take note of some bugs in the code: 

- sometimes a Bob won't be visible on the screen (Nexus 6 emulator)
- continiously entering the Leaderboard activity will reenter the previous score to the top 10
